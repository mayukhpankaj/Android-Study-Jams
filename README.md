**Problem Statement:**

Over past two years, local businesses have faced lot of troubles due to Covid-19 and lockdown imposed. This has resulted in low sales, payroll cuts , unemployment in stores. 
Many businesses have permanently closed,  across the world, affecting the world economics. 
Local consumers also face a lot of difficulties buying the neccessary, daily products. Limited, open hours, covid protocols made the situation worse.


Covid has impacted almost every business be it small or medium, and it's effect is not going anywhere with new variants coming each year.

**Proposed Solution :**

This can be solved if there's a way to connect local buyers to local consumers. Yes there is, Android smartphones. there are over 3 billion active android users around the globe. I have worked on a Local e-commerce android applciation which connects local e-commerce to to potential consumers. Increasing Seller's branding, reach and sales. business can share there info like storename, location and contact details, List products and offers. local users can browse through product list , sellers list.  
This will lead to sales growth and increased reach to consumers.
